Assignment Tasks:

1)Daily and Hourly Uptime Analysis:
Examine the uptime of chargers across different days and hours. Identify any noticeable uptime patterns or trends.

2)Performance Comparison of Charger Stations:
Compare the uptime performance of various stations. Highlight any stations with particularly high or low uptime and hypothesise potential reasons.

3)Correlation with Station Characteristics:
Analyse if the uptime is influenced by the station's characteristics (type, category, access). Does the nature of the station affect its operational status?

4)Predictive Analysis for Future Uptime:
Using the provided data, attempt to predict the uptime for the next day for a selected charger station. Explore the feasibility of forecasting potential downtimes.

5)Open-Ended Exploration:
Feel free to conduct any additional analysis that you find insightful. You might explore correlations with external factors like local events, weather conditions, or other variables not included in the dataset.
